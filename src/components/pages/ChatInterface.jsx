• **Risk Assessment**: Flag potential concerns in each contract

**🔍 Risk Analysis Results:**

• **Ambiguous Terms**: Found 3 clauses that need clarification
• **Hidden Costs**: Identified potential additional fees in Section 4.2
• **Timeline Risks**: Delivery obligations may conflict with payment terms
• **Liability Issues**: Limited liability clause heavily favors the other party

**⚠️ Key Concerns:**
- Termination clause allows for immediate cancellation without cause
- Intellectual property rights are not clearly defined
- Force majeure provisions are quite broad

• **Key Points**: 
  - Your rights and responsibilities
  - How disputes will be handled  
  - What happens if things go wrong
  - Payment and delivery terms

**🔑 Bottom Line**: 
This is a standard agreement with some important clauses about liability and termination. The terms are generally fair but pay attention to the cancellation policy.

**📖 Clause Explanation:**

**What it says**: "${message}"

**In Plain English**: 
This clause means that both parties need to give 30 days written notice before ending the agreement. It's basically a "cooling off" period to prevent sudden termination.

**Why it's important**:
• Protects both parties from sudden contract termination
• Gives time to find alternatives or resolve issues
• Standard practice in business agreements

**Other references in the document**:
• Section 3.4 mentions dispute resolution procedures
• Section 7.1 discusses breach of contract remedies
• Appendix B contains the notice requirements template
